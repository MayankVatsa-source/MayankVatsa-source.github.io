I analyzed a dataset using R for a company, Cyclistic, a bike sharing company in Chicago. Created an interactive dashboard showing how annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently. I also provided marketing strategies to convert casual riders to annual members.
#BACKGROUND

Cyclistic is a fictional bike sharing program which features more than 5,800 bikes and 600 docking stations. It offers reclining bikes, hand tricycles, and cargo bikes, making it more inclusive to people with disabilities and riders who can't use a standard two-wheeled bike. It was founded in 2016 and has grown tremendously into a fleet of bicycles that are geotracked and locked into a network of 692 stations across Chicago. The bikes can be unlocked from one station and returned to any other station in the system anytime.
